THe task given


The owner of a river boat hire company wants to calculate the daily profits from hiring out 10 rowing

boats on the river. Boats are numbered 1 to 10. Boats can be hired for use between 10:00 and 17:00

every day.

Write and test a program for the owner.

• Your program must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data.

• Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.

• All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.

You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.

TASK 1 – calculate the money taken in a day for one boat.

The cost of hiring a boat is $20 for one hour or $12 for half an hour. When a boat is hired the payment

is added to the money taken for the day. The running total of hours hired that day is updated and the

time when the boat must be returned is stored. At the end of the day the money taken and the total

hours hired is output.

No boat can be hired before 10:00 or returned after 17:00.

TASK 2 – find the next boat available.

Extend TASK 1 to work for all 10 rowing boats. Use the data stored for each boat to find out how many

boats are available for hire at the current time. If no boats are available show the earliest time that a

boat will be available for hire.

TASK 3 – calculate the money taken for all the boats at the end of the day.

At the end of the day use the data stored for each boat to calculate the total amount of money taken

and the total number of hours boats were hired that day. Find out how many boats were not used that

day and which boat was used the most. Provide a report for the owner to show this information.
